# Unemployment Rate Prediction

This project is a web application that uses a machine learning model to predict the unemployment rate based on two economic indicators: **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** and **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**. The app allows users to enter CPI and GDP values, predict the unemployment rate, and visualize predictions over time in a dynamic chart.

## Features

- **Model Prediction**: Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor model (or Gradient Boosting if chosen) for unemployment rate prediction.
- **Frontend with Visualization**: HTML frontend with Chart.js to visualize unemployment rate predictions dynamically.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Provides API endpoints for model prediction.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use form for inputting CPI and GDP values, and receiving predictions.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unemployment-prediction.git
cd unemployment-prediction
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `app/` directory and install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the FastAPI Application
Run the application using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the app.

## Usage

### Frontend
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2. Input **CPI** and **GDP** values into the form.
3. Click the **Predict Unemployment Rate** button to see the prediction displayed below the form.
4. The predicted unemployment rate will also be plotted on a line chart, which dynamically updates with each prediction.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /predict**: Takes JSON input with `cpi` and `gdp` values, returns the predicted unemployment rate.
    - **Request**:
        ```json
        {
            "cpi": 11.79,
            "gdp": 5.06
        }
        ```
    - **Response**:
        ```json
        {
            "prediction": 0.66
        }
        ```

### Frontend Visualization with Chart.js
The app includes a dynamic chart that visualizes the unemployment rate predictions over time. Each prediction is added to the chart, allowing users to track changes with each new input.

## Example Data

Example CPI and GDP values:
- **CPI Value**: `11.79127034`
- **GDP Value**: `5.061567755`

With these values, the model predicts an unemployment rate of approximately `0.66`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the application, try these steps:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Verify the trained model file (`random_forest_model.pkl`) exists in the `app/model/` directory.
3. Check that the FastAPI server is running by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the automatically generated API documentation.
4. If the prediction or chart isn't updating, check your browser’s JavaScript console for errors.
